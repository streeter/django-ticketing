## About

An implementation of a Django model that returns tickets, as described
in the [Flickr blog post][flickr].

## Installation

I uploaded it to [PyPi][pypi], so you can grab it there if you'd like with

```
pip install django-ticketing
```

or install it with pip using the git address:

```
pip install git+git@github.com:streeter/django-ticketing.git
```

Then add `ticketing` to your `INSTALLED\_APPS`.

## Usage

To use this, you can either use the model interface, or just the shortcut
function defined in `ticketing.models`. That usage looks like this:

```python
# Import the function
from ticketing.models import get_ticket
# Go get yourself a ticket
ticket = get_ticket()
# Boom. That just happened
```

This assumes you've had the single table that needs to be created in the DB,
in other words, you have run `syncdb` or migrated with e.g. [South][south].

### Multiple Sequences

`django-ticketing` also supports multiple sequences, which allows to have
sequences of tickets that are independent. This means you could have a sequence
for users, a sequence for posts and a sequence for widgets. This is configured
through your Django settings configuration.

Simply define a setting called `TICKETING\_SEQUENCES` with a tuple of sequence
names that have to be valid table names. This defaults to the tuple `('default',)`.
In addition, you can define the default sequence from which new tickets are
taken from with the setting `TICKETING_DEFAULT_SEQUENCE`, which defaults to
`'default'`.

Note that `TICKETING_DEFAULT_SEQUENCE` has to be a sequence name that is defined
inside of `TICKETING\_SEQUENCES`, otherwise an exception will be raised
during setup.

So to have sequences for the above example, put the following lines in your
`settings.py`:

``` python
TICKETING_DEFAULT_SEQUENCE = 'users'
TICKETING_SEQUENCES = ('users', 'posts', 'widgets', )
```

Then, to get a ticket from a specific sequence, pass in the sequence name to
`get_ticket()`:

``` python
# Get yourself a user ticket
user_ticket = get_ticket('users')
# Get yourself another user ticket
user_ticket = get_ticket()
# Get yourself a posts ticket
post_ticket = get_ticket('posts')
```

Notice that the default sequence for `get_ticket()` is the value of the
`TICKETING_DEFAULT_SEQUENCE` configuration variable.

Also, after you change the value of `TICKETING_SEQUENCES`, be sure to re-run
`syncdb` to make sure the new tables are created (or whatever DB table creation
you have in your environment).

### Other Configuration Options

`TICKETING_APP_LABEL`: This is used to specify the prefix for all the DB
tablenames. The default value is `'ticketing'`. Be sure you know what you are
doing when you change this.


## Testing

There are some tests included. To run those tests, simply execute `runtests.py`:

``` bash
[streeter] $ python runtests.py
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 6 tests in 0.213s

OK
[streeter] $
```

The test suite can run on all DB backends supported by Django. By default
it runs using sqlite3.
To run on MySQL, uncomment the marked section in `runtests.py`, create a
DB that Django can connect to and give the Django user permissions to
create a new testing DB, e.g. by running the following commands:

``` bash
mysql -u root -e "DROP DATABASE ticketing_test";
mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE ticketing_test";
mysql -u root -e "GRANT ALL ON ticketing_test.* TO 'ticketing_test'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY ''"
```

Of course, you may need to change the host of the DB and user that connects, but
you should get the idea.
